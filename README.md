# Phone is Home
Hello world in Scala. Sorta.

Continuously monitors to see if a given address is reachable. If it is, it'll prevent Nest going into auto-away.

Nest's auto-away stuff is all very well and good, but if I'm hiding upstairs all day it tries to freeze me to death.
This is used to monitor if one of our phones is on the home wifi, and if it is, it'll stop Nest going auto-away.

Manually setting away will still work, it's just auto-away we'll keep trying to cancel.
